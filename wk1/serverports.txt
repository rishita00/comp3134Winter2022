#What is the definition of server port?
->The port to handle external communications between a Web client and the Image server. Because of firewall restrictions, the Web server’s name is actually used to access the Image server and then all Image server traffic is then redirected to the Image server. The default is 3001 for both Windows and UNIX.

#What is server port range?
->Port numbers range from 0 to 65535, but only port numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports.

#How many bits does number above represent?
->Using the above formula you’ll see that the smallest four-digit number, 1000, requires 10 bits, and the largest four-digit number, 9999, requires 14 bits. The number of bits varies between those extremes. For example, 1344 requires 11 bits, 2527 requires 12 bits, and 5019 requires 13 bits.
